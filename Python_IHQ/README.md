# Learning Python by developing a script to check for differences between the analyst stats and the official source stats

<p>After an ice hockey game, there's two sources of data: the analyst's data and the official source provided by the NHL. It's quite common for the NHL to make changes or updates to their official stats post-game, and these alterations can negatively impact the analyst grade for the company's quality control team.</p>

<p>With this in mind, and fueled by curiosity to learn and develop my Python skills, I've decided to develop a script. This script takes the two sources of data (analyst and official source) at the end of the game and compares them to check for differences or errors. The goal is to automate the process for faster and more accurate results without adversely affecting the analyst's grade.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: This script is tailored to specific use cases and how the data files are created. It serves as a focused exercise for me to learn, think, write and create a Python script.<p>

<p>STATUS: UNFINISHED</p>
