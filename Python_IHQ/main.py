#   2.1. The player had no stats in game, which means it will not appear on the analyst list and it's stats on the source should be all zero = NO ERRORS
#   2.2. The analyst has errors in its data and this player has in game stats that should be counted = ERRORS EXIST
#   2.3. For both cases, just add the stats from the source list into the errors list
# 3. With the index of the current source_player, calculate the possible differences in the stats from the source with the analyst
