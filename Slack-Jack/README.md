## Slack Jack
We present you our blackjack game named SlackJack. Developed with lots of sweat, red-hot frustration and sleepless nights.

## Rules of the game
The objective of Slack Jack is simple: Beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total card value of 21.
Players will need to make decisions on whether to draw additional cards or end their turn based on their current hand.
But be careful, as exceeding 21 results in a 'bust,' and victory slips away.
