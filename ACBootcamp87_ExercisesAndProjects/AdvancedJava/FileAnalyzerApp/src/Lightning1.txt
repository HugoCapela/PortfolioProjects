Fourth place anthem playing tonight
On a broken radio
Thought we reached the mountaintop
But now we just feel so low
The sky is breaking open, we keep hoping
In the distance, we'll see a glow
Lightning, light our way
'Til the black sky turns back to indigo
We can make it if you don't quit on me
I won't quit on you
Don't quit on me
We can make it, baby
Please, don't quit on me
I won't quit on you
Don't quit on me
I'll never quit on you
We were born in paradise
Beneath the poisoned sky
Under a bad sign
The micro age of Gemini
And we are still unlearning
Tires are burning in the middle of Rodeo drive
You know that we've been beat down and broken
But now we can testify, ooh
We can make it if you don't quit on me
I won't quit on you
Don't quit on me
We can make it, baby
Please, don't quit on me
I won't quit on you
Don't quit on me
I'll never quit on you
It's not up to you
Some you win, some you lose (when the lightning comes)
You don't get to choose
Some you win, some you lose (when the lightning comes)
One, two, three, four
