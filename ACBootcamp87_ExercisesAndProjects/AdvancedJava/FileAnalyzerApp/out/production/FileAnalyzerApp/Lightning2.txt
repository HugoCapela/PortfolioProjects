I heard the thunder on a blue sky, perfect day
I wonder why, am I the only one?
I heard the thunder and I feel I'm going under
Jesus Christ was an only son
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light, what will the light bring?
I heard the thunder and I thought it was the answer
But I found I got the question wrong
I was trying to run away but a voice told me to stay
Put the feeling in a song
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light, what will the light bring?
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light, what will the light bring?
